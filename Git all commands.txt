git init -> for intialisation in vs code

git remote add origin (url) -> to add a remote named origin to our repoisitory
 
git remote remove origin -> to remove the origin we were

git remote -> to now in which origin we were 

git remote -v -> to make it ready for push and pull operations
o/p = fetch and push 

git config --global user.name "SAI CHARAN"

git config --global user.email "mailid"

git add demo.txt -> to add our txt file to git repository

git commit -m "added demo.txt"  -> to add our data to git repository 


git branch  -> it has 2 branches one is main branch and master branch 

so in vs code it is master initially so we need to change to main 

git branch -m main -> to change

git push -u origin main

git pull origin main  -> to pull data

echo "project file">>project.txt

creates new text file named project.txt and adds text project file to it.

.gitignore - predefined file for git 
the files mentioned in this will not push or pull 

// .env is should not be pushed as it will accessible to all so we should make it not push to anyone


create sample.env to specify the port number

.git ignore should be pushed after adding 

to add forcefullt use -f or delete


//to add branches 

git branch name

switch to our branch

git checkout nameofbranch

git branch -> to check the branch we are

add index.html file (create)

git add index.html
git commit -m "added index.html"
git push -u origin sai(branch name)

for example for a project working on 3 roles 
create 3 separate branches 
create branch , add , commit and push

to give msg another method -> 
git commit
to enter text type i at start for insertion 
type ur msg
enter esc after adding msg 
to quit - shift + ; = : w
q 


Should merge all this or connect 3 other branches to the main
